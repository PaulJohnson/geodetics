-- | A Grid is a two-dimensional projection of the ellipsoid onto a plane. Any given type of grid can
-- usually be instantiated with parameters such as a tangential point or line, and these parameters
-- will include the terrestrial reference frame ("Ellipsoid" in this library) used as a foundation.
-- Hence conversion from a geodetic to a grid point requires the \"basis\" for the grid in question,
-- and grid points carry that basis with them because without it there is no defined relationship
-- between the grid points and terrestrial positions.

-- | Convert a list of digits to a distance. The first argument is the size of the

-- of the specified offset.
